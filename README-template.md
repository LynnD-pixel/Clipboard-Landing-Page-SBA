This project is my implementation of the Bento Grid challenge from Frontend Mentor. 
My goal was to recreate a responsive bento-style layout that adapts between mobile and desktop screen sizes with Tailwind utility classes. 
I completed this project using HTML and Tailwind CSS, focusing on responsive design, with an accurate layout. 

My main focus was understanding and implementing the CSS Grid layout system correctly.
I used one grid container for both mobile and desktop layouts.
The layout is mobile-first, with cards stacking naturally in a single column on smaller screens.

Before writing code, I mapped out the grid structure visually to understand how each card should span across rows and columns. 

One of the challenges was understanding grid postioning, so I created a grid map to visualize the layout, to know where each card lived in the grid.
Initially, I used a lot of <div> wrappers, but I chose to simplify the html by styling semantic elements directly and only used the wrapper element when it directly helped my layout.
